List of files

A) Simulator
  1) dnaSeq2Digit: convert the DNA's bases into binary value (e.g. A = 00, C = 01, G = 10, T = 11)
  2) addNoise: insert Gaussian noise with a defined SNR value
  3) snrCheck: recheck SNR value
  4) sensorSimulator: the sensor simulation value    
      Ex: Test with SNR = 20 dB: sensorSimulator(20)         
          The chart of raw signal and raw signal with noise is displayed.          
          The real value of SNR is displayed.
